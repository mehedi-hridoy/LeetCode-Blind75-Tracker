# LeetCode Blind 75 Tracker

## About LeetCode Blind 75 Problems

The LeetCode Blind 75 is a carefully curated list of 75 coding problems aimed at helping software engineers prepare for technical interviews. These problems span key topics like arrays, dynamic programming, graphs, linked lists, trees, and more. Working through the Blind 75 problems is an effective way to strengthen problem-solving skills and grasp fundamental concepts often tested in coding interviews at top tech companies.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository hosts my personal LeetCode Blind 75 Tracker, a simple web application I created to track my progress as I solve the Blind 75 problems. The tracker organizes problems by category, allows me to mark them as solved, and displays my overall progress with a visual progress bar. It also saves my progress locally using the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring I can continue where I left off. This tool is designed for my personal use to stay organized and motivated on my journey to mastering the Blind 75 problems.

## Future Plans

While this tracker is currently for my personal use, I plan to enhance it in the future by adding a backend and making it open-source. This will allow anyone to easily log in and use the tracker to monitor their own progress through the Blind 75 problems, fostering a collaborative learning experience for the coding community.
